I am an assistant professor with [School of Science Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), and will be leading the Intelligent Motion And Interaction Laboratory (IMAIL). I was a postdoctoral fellow with [CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute (CURI)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ri/) and [Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)](https://www.hkclr.hk/). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/#), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), in 2021. My Ph.D. and postdoctoral supervisor is [Prof. Yun-Hui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Department of Automation](https://english.bit.edu.cn/2023-10/25/c_933762.htm), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), in 2014. I am currently also the (joint) assistant director of [CUHK Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Research Institute (Futian)](https://cufitri.cn/), and a member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and [IEEE RAS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/).

My research interest includes robot autonomy in surgical applications, medical robotics, intelligent motion planning and control, learning-driven 3D perception, etc.

I am currently looking for self-motivated prospective PhDs. If you are eager to conduct world-leading robotics research with me in motion planning and control, robot system design, AI-enabled sensing and actuation, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:fxzhong@cuhk.edu.cn) and drop your CV, thanks! :sparkles: :smile:
